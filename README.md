Hi, this is a simple ios app I made that mimics some features of Instagram. 
The features of the app includes:
    1. Populating popular feeds page from Instagram
    2. By clicking on user's profile picture or names for each media, nevigates to the user's media page
    3. Provide pull up refreshing feature

Instagram APIs have been applied in this app to fetch all the info needed.
